for pvt key provide pvt key of metamask acc
for rpc url check chainlink for latest available working rpc
for api key use polgon mumbai create app and use that
//Documentation for the built project 
-the project aims at listing previous data and medicines related to a disease in a decentralized way
-the following is the backend of the project
-the diseases are stored in solidity
-content are filtered and results are showed through backend
-technology stack-solidity/ether.js/express/postman
*create an empty directory 
'npm i -D hardhat"
"npx hardhat"
press enter 4 times
develop the solidity code
rewrite the deploy.js
change the hardhat.config.js by updating the pvt key(metamask acc pvt key),api key(create an app in polygon using desired rpc e.g-polygon mumbai), and rpc url by verifying the current availble rpc in chainlist
successfully displayed result for all diseases and create disease 
*to do update smart contract by creating search by remedies,name etc
--discovered:erc 20 abi should be provided from contract.json file
//created function create disease-which allows user to provide information on several disease
//get disease which provide list of diseases
//get disease by name, remedy,symptoms which enable user to search by the parameters
//this project is a take on ayurveda which stores a range of diseases,it aims at storing information in a decentralized way
//formally focuses on smart contract and backend
//future implementation-to add function which will sort disease by timestamp,hash function for symptoms-[Ascii encoder-decoder]
//target deadline:jan 2024
